# Automatic Hand Sanitizer Dispenser

![spray](./spraytodisinfect.png)

## System Documentation v1.0

## Project Overview
This automatic disinfectant sprayer is designed for shoe/foot sanitization using a downward-facing nozzle. When users hold their hands above the ultrasonic sensor (mounted on top), it triggers a spray mechanism that disperses disinfectant downward onto shoes/feet.

### Key Features
- Touchless operation via hand detection
- Downward spray configuration for foot sanitization
- Adjustable spray duration and intensity
- Wall-mountable or floor-standing design

### 1. Components List

| Component | Specifications | Purpose |

### 4. Installation and Positioning

#### Mounting Instructions
1. Mount ultrasonic sensor on the left side (0.8-1.0m height)
2. Position spray nozzle downward at 45° angle for optimal coverage
3. Secure pump motor inside container
4. Install splash guard around spray area (optional)
5. Mark standing position for users (recommended)
6. Connect all components following pin diagram
7. Fill disinfectant container

#### Optimal Setup
| Component | Position | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| Sensor | Top mounted, 1.2-1.5m height | Hand detection zone |
| Spray Nozzle | Downward 45° angle | Target feet/shoes |
| Standing Mark | 30cm from unit | Ideal spray coverage |
| Splash Guard | Around spray zone | Contain overspray |

### 5. Maintenance

| Component | Check Interval | Action Required |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Sanitizer Level | Weekly | Refill if below 20% |
| Sensor | Monthly | Clean surface |
| Battery | 3 months | Replace if applicable |
| Pump | 6 months | Check operation |

### 6. Troubleshooting

| Issue | Possible Cause | Solution |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| No dispensing | Empty container | Refill sanitizer |
| Weak spray | Low power | Check battery/power supply |
| No detection | Dirty sensor | Clean sensor surface |
| Continuous dispensing | Relay stuck | Check relay connections |

### 7. Operation Sequence

1. User approaches the unit
2. Holds hand 10-20cm above top-mounted sensor
3. Sensor detects hand presence
4. System activates pump motor
5. Disinfectant sprays downward onto shoes/feet
6. Spray continues for preset duration (default: 3 seconds)
7. System resets for next user
